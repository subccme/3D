3D carousel that moves in all direction and can be enlarged and rotated in all angles. You need to scroll with your two finger on the touchpad or scroll with the mouse to change the
perspective of the images. Hovering, moving in 360 degree is all supported. Touch devices may not be able to change the perpective or mirror the elements like you
can with two fingers in touchpad or mouse scroll button. Everything else works fine. Just try it.

update: the website seems to be working slowly in some mobile device. check if its smooth or not.
